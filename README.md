###### Sangini AI Rag: Freelance Project
Sangini AI is a RAG based system designed to process and understand large amounts of text data. It uses a **Vector Database (Qdrant)** to store and search information efficiently. The system has two main parts:

1. **Retrieval Pipeline**: It answers user queries by searching its database for relevant information and generating responses using an advanced AI model (LLM). For example, you can ask it questions, and it will provide accurate, context-aware answers.

2. **Ingestion Pipeline**: It processes and organizes data (like documents or articles) into smaller, meaningful pieces, converts them into vector embeddings (AI-readable format), and stores them in the database for future use.
In simple terms, it helps find and understand information quickly by combining smart data storage with AI-powered responses.

###### Skin Cancer Classification: Academic Project
I built an AI model that helps detect different types of skin cancer (like melanoma and benign lesions) from medical images. The goal was to assist doctors by providing a quick and reliable second opinion using image analysis.

The system was trained on thousands of real medical images and achieved an **accuracy of over 83%** in correctly identifying skin lesions. It uses advanced deep learning techniques to recognize subtle patterns that might be hard for the human eye to catch.

I also implemented features like **visual explanations (Grad-CAM)** so doctors can see _why_ the model made a particular prediction. This made the system more transparent and useful in a healthcare setting.

###### Doctor Saathi @ Innov8 Hackathon winner 
DoctorSaathi is an AI-powered medical assistant that helps users analyze medical images like X-rays and skin scans in real time. It can take live camera input or uploaded images to give quick preliminary assessments and suggest when to consult a doctor. The system also supports multiple languages, making it useful for people in rural or multilingual regions. Built using **LangChain** and **Computer Vision**, this project demonstrated how AI can make healthcare more accessible and interactive which was a part of a platform connecting rural communities with doctors.

##                                        AI +  Governance
###### AI Calling Agent @ Bhashini , Government of Maharashtra Hackathon Top 10
I built a voice-based AI assistant that enables real-time conversations in multiple Indian languages, helping government departments communicate better with citizens. The system could listen, translate, and respond intelligently using speech recognition and language translation technologies. It was optimized for rural users and supported dynamic language switching during calls. This project, built during the **Maha Hackathon**, was recognized among the **Top 10 finalists** in Maharashtra and gave me hands-on experience in creating accessible, voice-first AI solutions.
